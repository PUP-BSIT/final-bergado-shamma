      <h2>Thoughts about online class</h2>
      <div class="reasons">
        <p>
          I think the reason why we conducted face to face classes instead of
          online class is because we value hands on learning experiences and
          real-time interaction that leads us to deeper understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having an online class can be convenient to us as we are 
          experiencing
          a high heat index. We can also save our money and energy 
          consumed for
          commuting from our houses to PUP Taguig. Also, having an 
          online class
          will give them more access to necessary materials needed unlike in
          laboratory (not everyone has an internet connection).
