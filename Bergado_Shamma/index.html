        I have worked with Shamma on a number of projects, and each time, 
        she has produced timely,
        high-quality code. She is an exceptional developer due to her 
        ability
        to solve problems and her dedication to quality work.

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <div class="reflections">
        <p>
          Reflection 1: I can see myself 5 years from now, working in the 
          IT
          industry as a professional developer of a company. Being a 
          provider to
          my siblings, giving things my parents want, and being able to 
          buy
          things I like. I can see myself living with my man, being happy 
          and
          contented for who and what I became.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection 2: What do you want to be? I want to be a developer, 
          what
          kind of developer? Any of it, I really want to develop things 
          from
          scratch and design the whole system with my group or maybe with 
          my
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection 3: Where do you want to be? I want to work in Canada, 
          or
          any country but not Philippines. Why? I am not that fond of the
          weather. I prefer to live somewhere cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection 4: Despite the stress and the pressure you felt for 
          the
          past few months and probably the coming weeks, is it worth it? 
          For me,
          being pressured is one of the things that I really want. Why? 
          Because
          I realized that it is always pushing me to do my best, it is 
          giving me
          the thrill and the challenge. I grew up being bored at studying
          because honestly I already know all the topics my teachers are
          teaching, there is a time that I didn't attend our class for a 
          week
          and still I manage to get the highest score, it is so boring 
          knowing
          it all, and in this subject it is all new to me. Stress is normal 
          in
          studying or even at work, so it is not a big deal for me. Is it 
          worth
          it? I love it, I will surely watch videos from youtube to learn 
          more
          about javascript in my vacation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection 5: Do you still want to be here? I honestly do not 
          have a
          choice, but if you are going to ask me if I am enjoying my stay 
          here?
          Yes, I love learning new things.
