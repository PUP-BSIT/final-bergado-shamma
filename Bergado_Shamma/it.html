                    <b>Get the Right Degree</b>
                    <p>
                        The minimum academic requirement needed to 
                        work as an information technology specialist 
                        is a bachelor’s degree. You can pursue a degree 
                        in information technology, computer science, 
                        computer engineering or information technology 
                        management. All these programs take four years 
                        to complete and cover topics such as information 
                        technology system analysis, risk assessment, 
                        computer administration, information security 
                        and data networking.

                        Respected information technology specialists 
                        have great academic qualifications, so you 
                        might need to go beyond a bachelor’s degree. 
                        You can enroll in a master’s degree or even 
                        advance further to a doctorate degree. 
                        Common masters programs include Master in 
                        Technology Management and Master of Information 
                        Technology. A master’s and doctorate degree 
                        program widens your perspective in IT and trains 
                        you on how you can apply your information 
                        technology knowledge in real-life situations.

                    <b>Gain Experience</b>
                    <p>
                        Once you graduate, get a job, even 
                        if does not pay well. Take the job as 
                        a stepping stone towards greater things, 
                        rather than as a source of livelihood. 
                        You can begin by working as a technical 
                        support analyst or as a project management 
                        assistant. This exposure will help you 
                        learn how information technology infrastructures 
                        work and hone your troubleshooting skills. 
                        Get a company that is well recognized. This 
                        can be an IT consulting firm, government 
                        entity or even the military.

                    <b>Get Certified</b>
                    <p>
                        Once you acquire the right academic 
                        credentials and experience, you need 
                        to apply for certification from a 
                        recognized professional body. Nobody 
                        will take you seriously if you don’t 
                        have a professional certification. 
                        The best certifications include Project 
                        Management Professional (PMP), Certified 
                        Information Systems Auditor (CISA), 
                        Certified Information Systems Security 
                        Professional (CISSP) and Certified Information 
                        Security Manager (CISM). These certifications 
                        will increase your chances of getting advanced 
                        and well-paying jobs.

                    <b>Specialize</b>
                    <p>
                        The information technology field is 
                        very diverse. If you don’t specialize, 
                        you will not become an expert in anything. 
                        You can specialize on a particular product, 
                        on an area of information technology, such 
                        as mobile computing and data networking or 
                        on a brand such as Microsoft, Cisco or Apple. 
                        The key is to identify something that is very 
                        popular and interests you. Once you identify 
                        the area of specialization, reach out to people 
                        and make yourself the only person whom everyone 
                        comes to when they have a problem in that area.

                    <b>Network Widely</b>
                    <p>
                        You need to network widely to get your 
                        name out there. Without this, nobody 
                        will know that you are an information 
                        technology expert. In the end, you won’t 
                        get any job opportunities. Go out there 
                        and tell people about what you do. Open 
                        a Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn account 
                        and interact with people.
