            <p>
                A <b>teacher</b> , also called a school teacher
                or formally an educator, is a person who 
                helps students to acquire knowledge, competence, 
                or virtue, via the practice of teaching.

                    <b>Knowing your course options</b>
                    <p>
                        Preparing for a teaching profession starts 
                        before you step foot in college. First things 
                        first, you need to decide which education-related 
                        course to take. Different teaching jobs require 
                        different degrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to choose a course that’s aligned 
                        with the specific group of students you want to 
                        teach (students with special needs, pre-school, 
                        college). You also need to think about the subjects 
                        you want to handle (Math, Science, English) in the 
                        future. You can even consider taking a course that 
                        leads to a corporate “teaching” setting!

                        To give you an idea, here are some education 
                        courses you can take:

                                Major in Special Education

                    <b>Choosing a school that offers your course</b>
                    <p>
                        You’ll need to choose a school that offers 
                        your preferred education course, too. The 
                        good news is that there are many schools to 
                        choose from. If you want to find ‘the one,’ 
                        you need to consider a few things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alamin ang budget sa tuition at living expenses, 
                        especially if you’re planning to study at a 
                        school outside your home town. If your goal 
                        is to teach in an educational institution, it’s 
                        wise to consider the schools that top the Licensure 
                        Examinations for Teachers (LET).

                    <b>Taking the licensure exams for teachers</b>
                    <p>
                        Bago maging opisyal na guro, kailangan mo 
                        muna pumasa sa Licensure Examinations for 
                        Teachers (LET). The LET is held twice a year, 
                        so you have those chances to get qualifying 
                        marks. Applications open four months before 
                        your chosen exam date, and closes two months 
                        before the exam date.Remember to check the 
                        exam schedules, submit the requirements, 
                        register online, and pay the examination fee 
                        of Php 900.00 before taking the exam. Good luck!
