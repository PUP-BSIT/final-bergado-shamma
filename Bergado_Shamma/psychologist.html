            <h1>Psychologist</h1>
            <p>
                A <b>psychologist</b> is a trained mental health 
                professional who helps people learn healthy
                ways to handle mental health challenges.
                They can help people living with specific
                conditions, like depression or anxiety,
                or those who are going through a tough
                time in life, like grieving the loss of
                a loved one. They undergo years of education 
                and training to be able to provide a range of mental 
                health services.

            <h2>Four steps to becoming a psychologist</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Earn a bachelor’s degree</b>
                    <p>
                        Aspiring professionals can choose
                        to study any subject, but it may
                        be worth considering a major that
                        lends itself to a career in psychology,
                        such as social work, psychology, or sociology.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Earn a master’s and/or doctorate in psychology</b>
                    <p>
                        Depending on where you intend to practice
                        and the specific concentration you are 
                        interested in (e.g., child psychology,
                        social work, marriage and family therapy),
                        you may be able to pursue a psychology license 
                        after earning a master’s degree, either a 
                        Master of Arts or a Master of Science. If you
                        must pursue a doctoral degree, you will choose
                        between a PsyD, a practical degree for would-be
                        counselors; a PhD, which is more research-oriented;
                        an E.d.D, or Doctor of Education; and an EdS,
                        or education specialist. Check your state requirements
                        and consider your career goals to determine which 
                        degree is right for you.

                        program, you must complete an internship or 
                        postdoctoral program. This required psychology 
                        internship gives you an opportunity to work alongside
                        licensed psychologists to gain hands-on training in 
                        your field of interest. Most states require 1,500
