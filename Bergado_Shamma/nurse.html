            <p>
                <b>Nursing</b> encompasses autonomous 
                and collaborative care of individuals of all 
                ages, families, groups and communities, sick or 
                well and in all settings. Nursing includes the 
                promotion of health, prevention of illness, and 
                the care of ill, disabled and dying people.

            <h2>Steps to becoming a nurse</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Decide which type of nurse you want to be</b>
                    <p>
                        When choosing your career path, think about the 
                        type of work environment you prefer. For example, 
                        RNs can be found in hospitals, doctor’s offices 
                        and other medical settings, but certified nursing 
                        assistants often work in nursing homes. What type 
                        of setting will inspire you most?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should also consider what role you want to play. 
                        If you want to support medical staff as part of a 
                        team, a CNA or LPN/LVN could suit you well. If you 
                        want to manage other nurses and assistants or oversee 
                        systems, a career as an RN or advanced practice nurse 
                        is likely a good fit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because there are so many facets to healthcare, 
                        nurses often specialize in certain areas, such as 
                        geriatrics or critical care. If you have a passion 
                        for a certain type of nursing, consider the type of 
                        education you’ll need to get there.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Earn your nursing degree</b>
                    <p>
                        The career path you’re interested in 
                        pursuing will typically dictate the type 
                        of nursing degree you’ll need. Nursing 
                        programs include classroom instruction 
                        as well as clinical experience. Clinical 
                        training allows you to gain hands-on knowledge, 
                        ask questions in real-life scenarios and connect 
                        with nurses. The experience will also give you 
                        the chance to observe how a medical facility runs. 
                        Each degree will be a little different depending 
                        on the role it prepares you for.

                    <b>Pass the NCLEX and get state licensure</b>
                    <p>
                        Once you complete your education, you’ll 
                        need to take an exam to demonstrate your 
                        knowledge and nursing skills. Nurses also 
                        need to be licensed to practice and exams 
                        are prerequisites to licensing.

                    <b>Find a nursing job</b>
                    <p>
                        With a nursing shortage that is projected to continue, 
                        you should have plenty of options for the types of 
                        jobs that are available to you. Your clinical experience 
                        may have given you a taste for the different 
                        environments 
                        and settings in which you can work, so you’ll have an 
                        idea of what kind of environment is right for you.

                    <p>
                        Nurses are required to complete continuing 
                        education courses, usually every two years. 
                        Depending on where you practice, these may 
                        be listed as contact hours or as continuing 
                        education units (CEUs). Every state has different 
                        laws that determine how many hours of continuing 
                        education you need and how often. Check with your 
                        state nursing board for requirements.

                    <b>Maximize your potential through advanced training</b>
                    <p>
                        With new technologies and treatments, the healthcare 
                        industry is constantly evolving. Working on the front 
                        lines of healthcare requires nurses to stay informed 
                        and educated to remain effective as their 
                        responsibilities 
                        change. Employers also need nurses who are willing to go 
                        the extra mile and apply themselves to specific medical 
                        and surgical fields and hone their advanced knowledge. 
                        Nurses who pursue their careers from the perspective of 
                        lifelong learners may set themselves up for new 
                        opportunities 
                        and roles.
